"""Accept or reject items based on age categorization."""


from __future__ import unicode_literals


__version__ = '0.1.1'
EXTENDED_HELP = """
Timegaps accepts or rejects file system paths (items) based their modification
time. Its input is a set of items and certain categorization rules. The items
are then, according to the rules, classified into rejected and accepted items.
In the default mode, the output is the set of rejected items. If specified,
accepted or rejected items are deleted or moved. Find the detailed program
specification below.


Input:
    ITEMs:
        By default, an ITEM value is interpreted as a path to a file system
        entry. By default, the timestamp corresponding to this item (which is
        used for item categorization) is the modification time as reported by
        stat(). Optionally, this timestamp may also be parsed from the basename
        of the path. When interpreted as paths, all ITEM values must point to
        valid file system entries. In a different mode of operation, ITEM
        values are treated as simple strings w/o path validation, in which case
        the "modification time" must be parsable from the string itself.
    RULES:
        The rules define the amount of items to be accepted for certain time
        categories. All other items become rejected. Supported time categories
        and the RULES string format specification are given in the normal help
        text output of the program (--help). The exact method of item time
        categorization is explained below.


Output:
        By default, the program writes the rejected items to stdout, whereas
        single items are separated by newline characters. Alternatively, the
        accepted items can be written out instead of the rejected ones. The
        item separator may be set to the NUL character. Log output and error
        messages are written to stderr.


Actions:
        An action can be performed on each item, based on its classification.
        Currently, the deletion (--delete) or displacement (--move DIR) of items
        is supported. By default, no action is performed. If an action is
        specified, it is by default performed on rejected items only. This
        behavior can be changed with the --accepted switch. Note that accepted
        or rejected items are written to stdout just like in non-action mode.

        Remarks: the --time-from-string mode is not allowed in combination with
        --delete or --move. The --move action renames within one file system and
        copy-deletes in all other cases (cf. bit.ly/shutilmove). File system
        interaction errors (e.g. due to invalid permissions) are written to
        stderr and the program proceeds. By default, the deletion of directories
        requires the directory to be empty. Entire directory trees can be
        removed using -r/--recursive-delete.

        TODO: Add --strict mode (or something like that) that makes file system
        entry action errors fatal?


Time categorization method:
        Each item provided as input becomes classified as either accepted or
        rejected, based on its corresponding timestamp and according to the
        time categorization rules given by the user. For understanding the basic
        meaning of the categorization rules, consider this RULES string example:

            hours12,days5,weeks4

        It translates to the following <category>:<maxcount> pairs:

            hours: 12
            days:   5
            weeks:  4

        Based on the reference time, which by default is the program's startup
        time, the program calculates the age of all ITEMs. According to
        the example rules, the program tries to identify and accept one item
        from each of the last 12 hours, one item from each of the last 5 days,
        and one item from each of the last 4 weeks.

        More specifically, according to the <hours> rule above, the program
        accepts the *newest* item in each of 12 sub-categories: the newest item
        being 1 h old, the newest item being 2 h old, ..., and the newest item
        being 12 h old, yielding at most 12 accepted items from the <hours>
        time category: zero or one for each of the sub-categories.

        An hour is a real time unit, as are all time categories except for the
        <recent> category (explained further below). An item is considered
        X [time unit] old if it is older than X [time unit], but younger than
        X+1 [time unit]. For instance, if an item being 45 days old should be
        sub-categorized within the 'months' category, it would be considered
        1 month old, because it is older than 30 days (1 month) and younger
        than 60 days (2 months). All time category units are treated as linear
        in time (see below for time category specification).

        The example rules above can accept at most 12 + 5 + 4 accepted items. If
        there are multiple items fitting into a certain sub-category (e.g.
        <3-days>), the newest of these is accepted. If there is no item fitting
        into a certain sub-category, then this sub-category stays unpopulated
        and does not yield an item. Considering the example rules above, only 11
        items are accepted from the <hours> category if the input does not
        contain an item for the <5-hours> sub-category, but at least one item
        for all other <X-hours> sub-categories.

        Younger time categories have higher priority than older ones. This is
        only relevant when, according to the rules, two <category>:<maxcount>
        pairs overlap. Example rules:

            days:  10
            weeks:  1

        An item fitting one of the <7/8/9/10-days> sub-categories would also fit
        the <1-weeks> sub-category. In this case, the <X-days> sub-categories
        will be populated first, since <days> is a younger category than
        <weeks>. If there is an 11 days old item in the input, it will populate
        the <1-week> sub-category, because it is the newest 1-week-old item not
        consumed by a younger category.


        Currently supported time categories and their mathematical meaning:

            hours:   60 minutes     (3600 seconds)
            days:    24 hours      (86400 seconds)
            weeks:    7 days      (604800 seconds)
            months:  30 days     (2592000 seconds)
            years:  365 days    (31536000 seconds)

        The special category <recent> keeps track of all items younger than the
        youngest of the categories above, i.e. younger than 1 hour. It is not
        further sub-categorized. If specified in the rules, the <maxcount>
        newest recent items become accepted.


Exit status:
    0 upon success.
    1 upon expected errors detected by the program.
    2 upon argument errors as detected by argparse.
    >0 for other (unexpected) errors.

        # to file system interaction, byte strings are the more portable choice
        # on Unix-like systems.
        # See https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python3UnicodeDecodeError:
        # "A robust program will have to use only the bytes type to make sure
        #  that it can open / copy / remove any file or directory."
        #
        # On Python 3, which automatically populates argv with unicode objects,
        # we could therefore re-encode towards byte strings. See:
        # http://stackoverflow.com/a/7077803/145400

        # https://github.com/oscarbenjamin/opster/commit/61f693a2c553944394ba286baed20abc31958f03
        # On the other hand, there is http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0383/
        # which describes how surrogate encoding is used by Python 3 for
        # auto-correcting argument decoding issues (unknown byte sequences are
        # conserved and re-created upon encoding). Interesting in this regard:
